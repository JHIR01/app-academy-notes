- Object Notes -
- An object is a data structure that stores other data, similar to how an array stores elements,
- Objects acccociate keys and values
    - Keys are always strings
    - values can be any data type
- Objects differ from arrays in that:
    - data are always in key-value pairs
    - objects are indexed by keys
    - order is not guaranteed in an object
- Objects are defined by curly brackets "{}"

- Bracket Notion -
- to create an object and add an item to it you'll need both the key and the value
    - '[]' is used to give an item a key-value
    - '=' assigns the key to the value
    - Example:
        dog['name'] = 'Rover';
        dog['type'] = 'Husky';
        dog['name']; // will return 'Rover'
        dog['type']; // will return 'Husky'
        dog {name: 'Rover', type: 'Husky'} // this will assign all the attributes listed for the dog
- when indexing an Object it can be very similar to indexing an array. The difference is what type of data we use to index. 
    Objects are indexed using strings.

- Undefined Values in Objects -
- when attempting to get a key that is not defined in the object you will get an undefined.

- Using Variables as Keys -
