- Methods vs Functions - 
- A 'method' is essentially a function that belongs to an 
    object. 
- Every method is a function, but not every function is a 
    method.
    - 'myFunc' is a function
    - 'myObject.myFunc' is a method of the object 'myObject'
    - 'myObject["myFunc"]' is a method of an object 
        'myObject'
- Methods are just plain old functions at heart. 
- To call the method we need to specify which object is 
    calling. 
    - Example: 
        dog.bark();
        obj.methodName();

- 'this' and Methods -
- the keywords 'this' exists in every fucntion and it 
    evaluates to the object that is calling the method.
    - Exmaple: 
        var dar = {
            name: 'Fido',
            isSitting: true,
            stand: function() {
                this.isSitting = false;
                return this.isSitting;
            }
        };
        console.log(dog.isSitting); => // prints 'true'
        console.log(dog.stand()); => // prints 'false'
        console.log(dog.isSitting); => // prints 'false'
- 'this' keyword refers to the object that is calling the 
    method
- By using 'this' keyword inside a method, we can refer to 
    values of the object.

- Why are Objects useful? -
- creating objects is useful because it makes it easier to 
    reason about the correctness of our programs.

- Useful Methods -
- 'obejct.keys' accepts an object as the argument and 
    returns an array of all of it's keys.
    - example: 
        > var dog = {name: "Fido", age: "2"}
        undefined
        > Object.keys(dog)
        ['name', 'age']
- 'for (var key in object)' special syntax for an object to
    iterate though each key. This is useful for looping 
    through the keys and values of an object.
    - example:
        var obj = {name: "Mihir", age: "twenty-something"};
        for (var key in obj){
            console.log(key);
        }
        //prints: 'name', 'age'
    - If you want to access the values then, you'd switch 
    - example: 
        var obejct = {name: "Mihir", age: "twenty-something"};
        for (var key in obj){
            var value = obj[key];
            console.log(value);
        }
        // prints 'Mihir', 'twenty-something'
- Like all variable, you can name the key variable whatever
    you like. the hope is that you name it something 
    descriptive. 
    - example:
        var dog = {
            name: 'Fido',
            color: 'orange',
            age: 2
        };
        for (var potato in dog) {
            var value = dog[potato];
            console.log(value);
        }
        // prints 'Fido', 'orange', '2'
