- Multidimensional arrays -
- a multidimensional array is an array that holds another assortment of arrays
    - example:
        var multiArray = [
            [0, 1, 2],
            [3, 4],
            [5, 6, 7]
        ];

- Indexing Multi-Arrays -
- to index an item multidimensional array you'll have to get the index of the 
    array you'll want to index through. afterwards you'll want to get the 
    inside of the array.
    - example: 
        var multiArray = [
            [0, 1, 2],
            [3, 4],
            [5, 6, 7]
        ]
        // let's grab the first element of the send sub-array
        multiArray[1][0]; => 3
        //seonc element out of the seconc sub-array
        multiArray[1][1]; => 4
- the process of getting an element out of an array from another array is called
    double indexing.
- you can even index an array out of an array   
    - example: 
        return ['a', 'b', 'c'][1] => 'b'

- Iteratinf through Multi-Arrays -
- to iterate through a multi-array, you'll need to use a nested loop
- to iterate throuhg a 2D array, the outer loop will iterate through the outer array
    and the inner loop will iterate through each inner subarray
