- A nested loop is juts a for loop inside another for loop
- body of the loop - any code that is meant to run or written in the for-loop
- example: 
    for(var i = 1; i <= 3; i++)}{
        console.log('i', i);
        for(var j = 1; j <= 5; j++){
            console.log('   j', j);
        }
    }
    - this will log the first for loop and go into the inner for loop.
        once the inner for-loop is done looping, then the loop will
        return back to the outer loop and continue doing the same thing
        until the out for-loop has met it's conidtions.
- on every iteration from the outer loop, you'll need to iterate through    
    everything in the inner loop. 

- nested while-loop - 
- example:
    var i = 1;
    while(i <= 3){
        console.log("i", i);
        i++;
        var j = 0;
        while(j <= 5){
            console.log("   j", j);
            j++;
        }
    }
