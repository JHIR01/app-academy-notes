/**
 * -- Form Follows 'function' --
 * - In a case where you have an array that carries other arrays, or objects, understanding how each item in the array is structured is 
 *  important as making the array itself.
 * - side note:
 *  - using ',' is better for string concatination because you won't have to add a '+' sign to up the two strings together.
 * 
 * -- Good Naming (that's right, again) --
 * - Creating and name variables appropriately is key to handling complex data.
 * 
 * -- Data Modeling Options --
 * - say you wanted to create a function that tells how many times an item appears in an array. 
 *  - you could either present the data in a multidimentional array or as an object.
 * - Understanding that there is no right answer and that it depends upon the requirements of your system is what's more important. 
 *  - in the previous example both have their own benefits: 
 *      - multidimentional arrays help with readability 
 *      - objects are easier to manipulate once the data has been formed and returned
 *
