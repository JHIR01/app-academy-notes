/**
 * Write a function maxAdjacentSum(array) that takes in an array of 
 * numbers and returns the maximum sum of adjacent numbers in the array.
 * 
HINT: First think how we can find adjacent elements in an array!

Examples:
var arr1 = 5, 6, 11, 3;
maxAdjacentSum(arr1); => 17

var arr2 = 3, 2, 13, 5, 4, 7;
maxAdjacentSum(arr2); => 18
 */

function maxAdjacentSum(array){
    
}

var arr1 = [5, 6, 11, 3];
console.log(maxAdjacentSum(arr1)); // => 17

var arr2 = [3, 2, 13, 5, 4, 7];
console.log(maxAdjacentSum(arr2)); // => 18
