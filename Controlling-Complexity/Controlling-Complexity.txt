-- CONTROLLING COMPLEXITY --
- If we do not undertand out programs, we will inevitably introduce 
    bugs
- Decomposition and Abstructrion:
    - two ideas that will help understand the complexity of programs
- the main goal of a programmer is not to write code, but to solve
    a problem. 
    - the key to solves these problems is to break them down to be 
        more understandable and managable.

-- DECOMPOSITION --
- the process of braking down a larger problem into it's smaller
    sub-problems.

-- WHEN TO DECOMPISE INTO HELPER FUNCTIONS --
- there is no rule to decide when and how to decompose a large problem
- if you find that a single cuntion is getting overly complicated,
    spilt it off into another helper function to keep things under-
    standable.
- aim to keep function to do one thing and do it good.

-- Abstraction --
- abstruction is the process of hiding details.
